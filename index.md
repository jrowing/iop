## Outreach & consultancy

As part of my work with [https://www.exetermathematicsschool.ac.uk/](Exeter Mathematics School) I sometimes have occasion to go into schools with outreach presentations and resources. you'll find them here.

## Stimulating Physics Network
As part of the support network for teachers and pupils of physics, the Stimulating Physics Network (SPN) is run by the Institute of Physics in partnership with the Science Learning Network.

Within the SPN I am one of the Teaching and Learning Coaches (TLCs) and support Partner Schools with needs analysis, CPD for teachers, and pupil activities. I also deliver CPD Sessions on Physics and Teaching and Learning.
