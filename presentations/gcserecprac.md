# Aims
1. Student ideas/misunderstandings
2. The language of practicals
3. Have a play
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
 # Ofqual Requirements
* List of apparatus and techniques (AT) students need to be able to use.
* Required practicals (RPs) which incorporate all the ATs.
* 15% of the marks on each award cover aspects of practical work.
* Working scientifically (WS) is assessed.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
 # Assessment
* Across the papers at each level of demand.
* In exam papers a question is made up of items, which means that any question will assess content, practical, and maths skills. 
* There is no one correct method to achieve the learning.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Schools and colleges will be required to provide students with:
* A reasonable opportunity to do the RP activities.

</section>
  
<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Awarding organisations must require each school or college to sign a practical science statement declaration form.
This written statement will confirm that each learner:
* has completed the practical activities set by the awarding organisation
* has made a contemporaneous record of 
 * the work undertaken during those practical activities
 * the knowledge, skills and understanding gained.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
* No requirement to keep records of individual students attendance or competence in each required practical.
* No need to have a separate practical book/lab book to record learning.
* No prescribed requirement about what students record.
* No endorsement or monitoring visits, unlike A-level
