 # Ofqual Requirements
* Apparatus and techniques (ATs): list of apparatus students need to be able to use or techniques they need to be able to carry out.
* Required practicals (RPs) which incorporate all the ATs.
* 15% of the marks on each award will cover different aspects of practical work through the RPs.
* Working scientifically (WS) is assessed.
</section>

 # Assessment
* assessed across the papers at each level of demand using our full range of question types.
*  In exam papers a question is made up of items, which means that any question will often cover more than one AO and will assess both
content as well as practical skills and maths skills. 
* There is no one correct method to achieve the learning â€“ suggested methods can be found in the practical handbooks.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Schools and colleges will be required to provide students with a reasonable opportunity to do the RP activities.
* Awarding organisations must require each school or college to sign a practical science statement declaration form.
* This written statement will confirm that the school or college has taken reasonable steps to secure that each learner:
 * has completed the practical activities set by the awarding organisation
 * has made a contemporaneous record of:
 * the work which the student has undertaken during those practical activities
* the knowledge, skills and understanding which the student has derived from those practical activities.
</section>

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Agree with your head of school what they will require to see to ensure they are able to sign the declaration form.
* No requirement to keep records of individual students attendance or competence in each required practical.
* No need to have a separate practical book/lab book to record learning.
* No prescribed requirement about what students record this should be flexible to reflect what your learning objectives and outcomes are for the lesson.
* If a student is absent for the RP lessons then this should be treated like missing any other part of the specification and caught up like an other part of the specification. There is no requirement to rerun the activity.
* No endorsement or monitoring visits, unlike A-level
