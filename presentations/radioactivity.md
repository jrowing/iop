# True or False

* Radioactive substances make everything near to them radioactive.
* Once something has become radioactive, there is nothing you can do about it.
* Some radioactive substances are more dangerous than others.
* Radioactive means giving off radio-waves.
* Saying that a radioactive substance has a half life of three days means any produced now will all be gone in six days

 # What Do students think

The following questions were given to 144 school students aged 15â€“16 years and drawn from four schools. 
The students had all previously studied the topic of radioactivity.

In a demonstration experiment, a teacher places a Geiger counter near a radioactive source. The counter counts quite rapidly. The teacher then moves the Geiger Counter away from the source. As she does this, the count rate gradually goes down. By the time she has moved the counter right across the room, the Geiger counter has almost stopped recording any counts.                  								 
Explain why the Geiger counter counts less and less as it is moved away from the source.

 # Answers:
* Emitted radiation diverges from source.
* Radiation causes ionisation of the air.
* Intensity (count rate) decreases with distance.

 In April 1986, a serious accident occurred at the nuclear power station at Chernobyl in Russia. A week later, radiation detectors (Geiger counters) in Britain recorded higher  than usual levels of radiation. Britain is more than 1000 miles from Chernobyl!       	         								 Explain what reached the Geiger counters in Britain to make them record extra counts.

# Answers
* Radioactive material reached the UK.
* Radioactive material was transferred by the wind.
* Radioactive material emits radiation.
