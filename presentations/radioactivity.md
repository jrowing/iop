# True or False

* Radioactive substances make everything near to them radioactive.
* Once something has become radioactive, there is nothing you can do about it.
* Some radioactive substances are more dangerous than others.
* Radioactive means giving off radio-waves.
* Saying that a radioactive substance has a half life of three days means any produced now will all be gone in six days

 # What Do students think
 </section>
 
 
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
The following questions were given to 144 school students aged 15–16 years and drawn from four schools. 
The students had all previously studied the topic of radioactivity.
 </section>
 
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
 
In a demonstration experiment, a teacher places a Geiger counter near a radioactive source. The counter counts quite rapidly. The teacher then moves the Geiger Counter away from the source. As she does this, the count rate gradually goes down. By the time she has moved the counter right across the room, the Geiger counter has almost stopped recording any counts.                  								 
Explain why the Geiger counter counts less and less as it is moved away from the source.
</section>
 
<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
 # Answers:
* Emitted radiation diverges from source.
* Radiation causes ionisation of the air.
* Intensity (count rate) decreases with distance.
 </section>
 
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
 In April 1986, a serious accident occurred at the nuclear power station at Chernobyl in Russia. A week later, radiation detectors (Geiger counters) in Britain recorded higher  than usual levels of radiation. Britain is more than 1000 miles from Chernobyl!       	         								 Explain what reached the Geiger counters in Britain to make them record extra counts.
 </section>
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
# Answers
* Radioactive material reached the UK.
* Radioactive material was transferred by the wind.
* Radioactive material emits radiation.
 </section>
 
 
<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Many students confuse ‘radiation’ and ‘radioactive material’. 
After the Chernobyl accident, many newspaper articles referred to a “cloud of radiation” and drinking water contaminated with “radiation”.
</section>
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Many students appear to interpret the idea that “radiation is absorbed” differently from the scientific interpretation. They believe that objects that have been irradiated will themselves become radioactive – that they can re-emit the radiation some time later. 
The underlying idea here is that they seem to think that radiation is somehow “conserved”. This is, of course, what we mean by ‘absorbed’ in everyday language. For example, when we say that a sponge has absorbed water, we assume that it can re-emit it at a later date.

| Radioactive     | An adjective for anything that emits radiation*                                                           |
| Radiation       | The particles and photons emitted by unstable nuclei (alpha, beta, gamma)                                 |
| Contamination   | When the radioactive material gets inside something (like you) or on skin                                 |

| Irradiation     | When the radioactive material is outside and the radiation it produces hits something                     |

# Pedantry:
 
The Radiation Protection Division of the Health Protection Agency defines a radioactive substance as having a specific activity greater than or equal to 400 Bq/kg.

  # Stories to engage
 </section>
  <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
1841- Eugene Peligot discovers uranium
   
1895 – William Roentgen discovers X-rays

1896 – Henri Becquerel discovers that rocks that contain uranium emit radiation

1988/9 – Marie Curie discovers radium, polonium and thorium

1903 – Becquerel, and the Curies get Nobel Prize
 </section>
 
 <section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">
Many know that Madame Curie’s work led to her untimely demise, but few know the lasting effects that the radiation exposure has had on her belongings. 
 
Currently, her notebook is so radioactive that it must be stored in a lead box.

To be able to view her personal belongings, you need protective clothing and a liability waiver.

  # You are radioactive:
 Typically 7000 Bq. So “it’s dangerous to sleep with somebody”! However, most of the resulting radiation is absorbed within the ‘owners’ body.
 
Mass of typical student = 70 kg, so specific activity = 7000/70 = 100 Bq/kg (threshold is 400Bq/kg)

<section data-markdown data-notes="^Note:">

Stable nuclei need the right proportion of neutrons and protons.
Some nuclei (e.g. 4He) are particularly stable – why alpha particles are commonly emitted.
After a or b decay nucleus may be in an excited (high energy) state and emit a $ \gamma $ ray photon.
